## Hello!

## And welcome to my humble

# **_NVIM_** **CONFIG**!

Some time ago, i decided to refuse use VSCode despite it was felt so confy and I appriciate it as well even now (to be honest hi-hi)...

But i won't be a good programmer without pushing myself to something uncomfortable, which VIM, sorry, **NeoVim** becomes in this case.

First time it was struggling and challenging for a while, but with time it becomes more and more cosily(or no?)

This config is NOT perfect: you will see that here wasn't any vertical cursor plugin (which i used so often in VSC), well configured Alpha plugin for welcoming in vierge state, but anyway - it's work and I will upgrade it as the same time than I continue write with Nvim.

And the last questions for true borings: I use neovim principally for it's great and wide community and possibility to write in Lua!

Brick by brick.
